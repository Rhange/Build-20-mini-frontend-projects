## Couldn't self-complete 1st project
- In design, HTML and CSS, I did myself. But, in JS part, I didn't well enough implement a part of operating error bars 
at the same time. So I wrote following a solution code and after that I tried to code only myself.
- After 2nd project, I will must do it myself then after finish it, I will watch a solution for the project and review with my code.
